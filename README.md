Assignment 1:
Write recursive functions for the following:

a) int rem(int x, int y) where x >=0 and y > 0, to compute the remainder of x divided by y.
	Also, Write following JUnits cases:
rem(2, 1)
rem(2, 0)
rem(100, 3)

b) int gcd(int x, int y) where x > 0 and y > 0, to compute the greatest common divisor of x and y. 
	Also, Write following JUnits cases:
gcd(2, 1)
gcd(12, 18)
gcd(100, 3)

c) int largestdigit(int x) where x >= 0,  to find out the largest digit in the number x.
	Also, Write following JUnits cases:
largestdigit(2)
largestdigit(1257369)
largestdigit(444)

Assignment 2:
Write recursive functions for the following:

a) to search for a given value x in an array using linear search strategy.
Write JUnit Tests:
take an array having {2,5,8,9,10, 77, 55}, and search 88
take an array having {2,5,8,9,10, 77, 55, 11}, and search 77

b) to search for a given value x in an array using binary search strategy.
Write JUnit Tests for each function:
take an array having {2,5,8,9,10, 55, 77}, and search 88
take an array having {2,5,8,9,10, 55, 77}, and search 77


Assignment 3:
Write a recursive function to sort the given array in ascending order using quicksort.
Write JUnit Tests for above function.
Sort this array {2,5,8,9,10, 77, 55, 11}
Sort this array {}
